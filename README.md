## Goals
* Increase **usability** of an existing product - DVR (digital video recorder) remote
* Practice **low-fidelity sketching**
* Create a mobile-first designed **rapid prototype** using a framework

## Background
Remote controls are notorious for their lack of usability. Too many buttons arranged poorly with inconsistent designs. Today many apps exist - search "remote control" in any app store - to convert mobile devices into touch-screen remote controls. The best apps take advantage of the new interface and the infinite screen space. The worst apps simply mirror physical remotes.

* [5 Apps for your Phone](http://gizmodo.com/5982909/5-apps-to-turn-your-phone-into-a-universal-remote)

## Research
Use research to define the objectives of the project. Gather a collection of physical remotes. Begin to list the requirements in ranked order of importance and usage. Create a new Wiki paged named **DVR App Research** for this content. Add to repo - see below for Setup & Submission.

## Sketching
Firstly, review available components from Zurb Foundation framework. Second, Use paper mockups/templates to sketch layout, features, and interactions (e.g. off canvas layouts). Quickly sketch and iterate, iterate, iterate.

## Prototype
Using the Zurb 5 Foundation framework, create an interactive mobile prototype. Users should be able to click/tap through the interface. Provided are iPod Touches for testing. Feel free to use your own mobile device also. 

Additional styling is optional. Use existing Foundation UI, or modify to it. Features first, then style.
